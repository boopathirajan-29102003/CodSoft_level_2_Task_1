                    <h4 class="head_content">Early Life and Formation of Apple (1955–1979)</h4>
                    <p class="para_content">Born on <b>February 24, 1955,</b> in San Francisco to a Syrian father and
                        German-American mother, Steve
                        Jobs embarked on a journey that would reshape the tech landscape. Adopted shortly after birth,
                        his pursuit of knowledge led him to <b>Reed College in 1972</b>, where he briefly attended
                        before
                        withdrawing. In 1974, a transformative trip to India for enlightenment and later studies in Zen
                        Buddhism set the stage for his profound impact on the world.</p>
                    <p class="para_content">In collaboration with his <b>visionary partner Steve Wozniak</b>, Jobs
                        co-founded <b>Apple in 1976</b>, marking
                        the genesis of the personal computer revolution. Their first success came with the Apple II in
                        <b>1977</b>, a pioneering mass-produced microcomputer that brought them fame and wealth.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="head_content">The Xerox Alto and Technological Innovation (1979–1984)</h4>
                    <p class="para_content">Recognizing the potential of the <b>Xerox Alto in 1979</b>, a mouse-driven
                        computer with a graphical
                        user interface (GUI), Jobs spearheaded the development of the Apple Lisa in 1983. Despite
                        initial setbacks, this paved the way for the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984—the first
                        mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh not only transformed the industry but also
                        introduced desktop publishing in 1985 with the Apple LaserWriter, featuring vector graphics.</p>
                    <h4 class="head_content">Departure from Apple and Ventures Beyond (1985–1997)</h4>
                    <p class="para_content">In <b>1985</b>, a power struggle led Jobs to depart from Apple. Undeterred,
                        he founded NeXT, focusing on
                        computer platform development for higher education and business markets. Simultaneously, Jobs
                        contributed to the visual effects industry by funding the computer graphics division of
                        Lucasfilm in <b>1986</b>, which later became the acclaimed animation studio, Pixar. The studio
                        produced
                        groundbreaking films, including the first 3D computer-animated feature, Toy Story (1995).</p>
                    <h4 class="head_content">Apple's Renaissance and Steve's Triumphant Return (1997–2011)</h4>
                    <p class="para_content">In a pivotal moment in <b>1997</b>, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the
                        acquisition of NeXT. Faced
                        with a company on the brink of bankruptcy, his leadership and collaboration with designer Jony
                        Ive led to a cultural revolution. From the iconic <b>"Think Different"</b> campaign to the
                        creation of
                        transformative products like the <b>iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone, and iPad</b>, Jobs revitalized
                        Apple's
                        identity.</p>
                    <h4 class="head_content">Legacy and Recognition (2011 Onward)</h4>
                    <p class="para_content">In 2003, Jobs faced a health challenge with a pancreatic neuroendocrine
                        tumor, leading to his
                        passing in <b>2011 at the age of 56</b>. Tim Cook succeeded him as CEO, continuing to build upon
                        the
                        foundation laid by Jobs. In <b>2022</b>, Steve Jobs was posthumously awarded the Presidential
                        Medal of
                        Freedom, a testament to his enduring impact on technology, innovation, and culture. </p>
